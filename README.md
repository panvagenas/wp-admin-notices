## What is it?
This is a simple lib to manage and display WordPress notices in admin page

## How to use it?

### Load with composer

The recommended method to load this script in your plugin or theme, is to use composer.
To do so add the following line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "panvagenas/wp-admin-notices": "*"
    }
}
```
or run 

`composer require panvagenas/wp-admin-notices`

### Basic usage

Whenever you want to enqueue a notice you will first have to create it
```php
<?php
// Create a notice
$notice = new WP_Updated_Notice('Your message here');

// And add enqueue it
WP_Admin_Notices::getInstance()->addNotice($notice);
```

Next time a page is loaded in admin panel the notice will be displayed

### Notice types

There are three classes of notices you can use:

1. `WP_Notice::TYPE_ERROR`
2. `WP_Notice::TYPE_UPDATED`
3. `WP_Notice::TYPE_UPDATED_NAG`

These classes affects the layout of the notice to be displayed. Read more [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices).

### Arguments for `\Notices\WP_Notice` class

You can pass these arguments in when constructing notices of the above classes

1. `$content`: String. The content of your notice
2. `$title`: Title of the notice, optional default is empty string.
3. `$type`: Type of the notice, must be `WP_Notice::TYPE_ERROR`, `WP_Notice::TYPE_UPDATED` or `WP_Notice::TYPE_UPDATED_NAG`
3. `$times`: int. Optional. Number of times that this notice should be displayed. Default is 1
4. `$screen`: Array. Optional. An array containing screen ids of the screens this notice should be displayed on. Default empty array displays it anywhere.
5. `$users`: Array. Optional. An array containing user ids (eg. `options-general`) of the users to whom this notice should be displayed. Default empty array displays it to any user.

### Sticky notes

Sticky notes are a special case in which the user must interact with it to dismiss it. You can create a sticky note simply by setting the flag `WP_Notice::$sticky` to `true`:

```php
<?php
// Create a notice
$notice = new WP_Updated_Notice('Your message here');
$notice->setSticky(true);

// And ofcourse enqueue it
WP_Admin_Notices::getInstance()->addNotice($notice);
```

WP Admin Notices will create a sticky note with `Pan\Notices\Formatters\WordPressSticky` formatter. The end user can dismiss this note by pressing the `Ã—` mark. Dismissal request 
is performed through Ajax, so no screen loading.

### Using formatters

`\Notices\WP_Notice` instances make use of formatters to get the actual output of the notice.
Default formatter is `\Notices\Formatters\WordPress` so you can use this script as is. 

If you want to create your own formatter you should create a class that extends `\Notices\WP_Notice\FormatterInterface`.
This class must implement the `formatOutput( WP_Notice $notice )` method that accepts an instance of `\Notices\WP_Notice`
as its only parameter and returns the output to be displayed.
